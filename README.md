# Ariel-Short-Sighted-Scheduler
A simple, short-sighted scheduler for Ariel.
Currently limited, mainly by target list. Additionally, it only simulates missions ofr one tier at a time, and ignores tier 4 targets (phase curve observations).

## To Run
Open directory containing ```SimpleScheduler.py```. Ensure that you add appropriate variables as arguments and watch it run. Will return some potentially useful data for later analysis. See the python file to see what each variable is for.
